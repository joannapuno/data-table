WIP~ Under Construction but feel free to look around!

# A Personal Design System

Consists of React components I've created to make it easier for me to create React projects. Since I want to follow my own design system, I figured it makes sense to just have one library for it.

Once I've gotten about 50%-60% done, I'd like to move all these to Storybook! :D
I love ducks so I named this Design System "Sweet Duckling"

# Playground

Just experimenting right now so this project is just my playground atm~ I'd like to see how I will use the components before they make it into Sweet Duckling~
